## Description

This is a set of plugins for Sequel for declaring a model's table schema and
any migrations in the class itself (similar to the legacy `schema` plugin).

It has only really been tested with PostgreSQL, but patches that make it more generic are welcomed.

The two plugins are:

* Sequel::Plugins::InlineSchema
* Sequel::Plugins::InlineMigrations

Examples and usage documentation are included there.


## Prerequisites

* Ruby >= 2.4
* Sequel >= 5.0


## Installation

    $ gem install sequel-inline_schema


## Contributing

You can check out the current development source with Mercurial via its
[project page][sourcehut]. Or if you prefer Git, via [its Github
mirror][github].

After checking out the source, run:

    $ gem install -Ng
    $ rake setup

This will install any missing dependencies, and do any other necessary setup to
start development.
